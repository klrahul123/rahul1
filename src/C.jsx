          C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.
          Our C tutorials will guide you to learn C programming one step at a time. <br /> <br />
          <h2>About C Programming</h2> <br />
          <h5 class="nya"> Procedural Language </h5>- Instructions in a C program are executed step by step.
          <h5 class="nya"> Portable </h5> - You can move C programs from one platform to another, and run it without any or minimal changes.
          <h5 class="nya"> Speed </h5>- C programming is faster than most programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
          <h5 class="nya"> General Purpose </h5>- C programming can be used to develop operating systems, embedded systems, databases, and so on. <br /> <br />
          <h2>Why Learn C Programming?</h2> <br />
          -C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information. <br />
          -After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc. <br />
          -Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C <br />

          -a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. <br />
          -To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. <br />
          For example: <br />
          <h6 class="nyapan"> int Score = 90; </h6> <br />    
          <h5 class="nya"> Rules for naming a variable </h5> 
          -A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore. <br />
          -The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore. <br />
          -There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters. <br /> <br />

          <Typography>
          In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of data associated with variables. <br />
          A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, character, etc. <br />

          For example, <br />
          <h6 class="nyapan"> int myVar; </h6> <br />
          Here, myVar is a variable of int (integer) type. The size of int is 4 bytes. <br />

<h6 class="nyapan"> int myVar; </h6> <br />
<h5 class="nya"> float and double </h5> 
-float and double are used to hold real numbers. <br />
<h6 class="nyapan"> float salary; <br />
 double price; </h6> <br />
 <h5 class="nya">  char </h5>
 -Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. <br />
  For example, <br />
  <h6 class="nyapan"> char test = 'h'; <br /></h6> <br />
  <h5 class="nya">  void </h5> <br />
  -void is an incomplete type. It means "nothing" or "no type". You can think of void as absent. <br />

-For example, if a function is not returning anything, its return type should be void. <br />

-Note that, you cannot create variables of void type. <br />

C programming has two operators increment ++ and decrement -- to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment ++ increases the value by 1 whereas decrement -- decreases the value by 1. These two operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.

          <Typography>
          a loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met. <br />
          C programming has three types of loops: <br />
          1-for loop <br />
          2-while loop <br />
          3-do...while loop <br />

          The syntax of the for loop is: <br />
          <img src={forloop} alt="" /> <br />
          How for loop works? <br />
          -The initialization statement is executed only once.
Then, the test expression is evaluated. If the test expression is evaluated to false, the for loop is terminated.
However, if the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of the for loop are executed, and the update expression is updated.
Again the test expression is evaluated. <br />
This process goes on until the test expression is false. When the test expression is false, the loopterminates. <br />

          The while loop evaluates the testExpression inside the parentheses ().
If testExpression is true, statements inside the body of while loop are executed. Then, testExpression is evaluated again.
The process goes on until testExpression is evaluated to false.
If testExpression is false, the loop terminates (ends). <br /> <br />
       <h5 class="nya"> do...while loop</h5> <br /> <br />
       The do..while loop is similar to the while loop with one important difference. The body of do...while loop is executed at least once. Only then, the test expression is evaluated. <br />

       How does the switch statement work? <br /> <br />
       -The expression is evaluated once and compared with the values of each case label. <br />
       -If there is a match, the corresponding statements after the matching label are executed. For example, if the value of the expression is equal to constant2, statements after case constant2: are executed until break is encountered.
If there is no match, the default statements are executed. <br />

          A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. <br />
          Types of function: <br />
          There are two types of function in C programming: <br />
          1-Standard library functions <br />
          2-User-defined functions <br /> <br />

          Standard library functions: <br />
          The standard library functions are built-in functions in C programming. <br />

          These functions are defined in header files. For example, <br />
          -The printf() is a standard library function to send formatted output to the screen (display output on the screen). This function is defined in the stdio.h header file. <br />
          -The sqrt() function calculates the square root of a number. The function is defined in the math.h header file. <br /> <br />  
          
          <h5 class="nya">   User-defined function:</h5> <br /> 
          You can also create functions as per your need. Such functions created by the user are known as user-defined functions. <br />
          How user-defined function works? <br />
          <img src={funct} alt="" /> <br /> <br />
          Note, function names are identifiers and should be unique. <br /> <br />

          An array is a variable that can store multiple values. For example, if you want to store 100 integers, you can create an array for it. <br /> <br />
          int data[100]; <br /> <br />

          How to declare an array? <br />
          dataType arrayName[arraySize]; <br /> <br />

          Access Array Elements- <br />
          - You can access elements of an array by indices. <br /> <br />
          Note: <br />
          - Arrays have 0 as the first index, not 1. In this example, mark[0] is the first element. <br />

           -If the size of an array is n, to access the last element, the n-1 index is used. <br /> <br />

Define Structures <br /> 
-Before you can create structure variables, you need to define its data type. To define a struct, the struct keyword is used. <br /> <br />

          <Typography>
           A union is a user-defined type similar to structs in C except for one key difference. <br />

           Structures allocate enough space to store all their members, whereas unions can only hold one member value at a time. <br /> <br />

           How to define a union? <br />
           We use the union keyword to define unions. Here's an example: <br />

          -A file is a container in computer storage devices used for storing data. <br /> <br />
          File Operations <br /> <br />
In C, you can perform four major operations on files, either text or binary: <br />

-Creating a new file <br />
-Opening an existing file <br />
-Closing a file <br />
-Reading from and writing information to a file <br /> <br />

          <Typography>
          -C Standard library functions or simply C Library functions are inbuilt functions in C programming. <br />

          -The prototype and data definitions of these functions are present in their respective header files. To use these functions we need to include the header file in our program. <br /> <br />
          Advantages of Using C library functions <br />
          1. They work <br />

One of the most important reasons you should use library functions is simply because they work. These functions have gone through multiple rigorous testing and are easy to use. <br />


2. The functions are optimized for performance <br />

Since, the functions are "standard library" functions, a dedicated group of developers constantly make them better. In the process, they are able to create the most efficient code optimized for maximum performance. <br />

3. It saves considerable development time <br /> <br />
Library Functions in Different Header Files <br />
<img src={headerfunc} alt="" />

Since the general functions like printing to a screen, calculating the square root, and many more are already written. You shouldn't worry about creating them once again.

4. The functions are portable

With ever-changing real-world needs, your application is expected to work every time, everywhere. And, these library functions help you in that they do the same thing on every computer.
